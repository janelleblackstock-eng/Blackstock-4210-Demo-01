    <br>
    <p class="lead">Helen is a mountain town in northeast Georgia, known for its Bavarian-style architecture and stunning natural beauty.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4" style="color: var(--helen-green);"><i class="fas fa-history me-2"></i>History</h4>
    <p>In 1969, local business owners decided to revitalize the struggling logging town by adopting an Alpine theme. Artist John Kollock designed the transformation, and soon every building was converted to the distinctive Bavarian style we see today. The makeover turned Helen into one of Georgia's top tourist destinations.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4" style="color: var(--helen-blue);"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt me-2"></i>Location</h4>
    <p>Located about 90 miles north of Atlanta in White County, Helen sits at an elevation of 1,447 feet in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Chattahoochee River runs right through the heart of downtown, adding to the town's scenic charm.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4" style="color: var(--helen-green);"><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt me-2"></i>Best Time to Visit</h4>
    <p>Helen is beautiful year-round! Spring brings wildflowers and waterfalls, summer is perfect for tubing, fall offers spectacular foliage and Oktoberfest, and winter has a cozy holiday atmosphere with occasional snow dustings in the mountains.</p>
